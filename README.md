Kinvey Java Library
======

This library is a standalone library designed for all java evnironments.
The library acts as a client for the Kinvey REST api and can be used for
building Android apps and Java6 server applications.

It is recommended you use either IntelliJ or Android Studio. Eclipse is NOT recommended.

## Documentation
Refer http://devcenter.kinvey.com/android for complete documentation of the library APIs and usage.

## Overview of the Library

The codebase is made of the following key projects at the top level (under java-library): 

### java-api-core 
The core of the library. Most of the library logic is written here. This project contains most of the underlying networking, user management, caching logic. Things that are platform specific (android-specific or standalone-java-specific) are represented as interfaces / abstract classes, and implemented in the other libraries described below.

### android-lib
The wrapper library for android, built on top of java-api-core. All the android specific implementation goes here. Most of the classes in this library extend from the ones in java-api-core.

### java-lib
The wrapper library for java, built on top of java-api-core. All the standalone-java specific implementation goes here. Most of the classes in this library extend from the ones in java-api-core.

### android-secure
Encryption module built on top of android-lib. Rarely used; not compiled into the standard build process. This may be requested by certain customers who need encryption in their app.

### samples 
Samples built on top of the libraries. This is a submodule, the full source for samples is under https://github.com/KinveyApps

## Build
Pre-requisites:

* [android sdk](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* Set JAVA_HOME
* Set ANDROID_HOME
* Download android_sdk/platforms/android-19, android_sdk/platforms/android-10

```
./gradlew clean
```

```
./gradlew release
```
After these steps .zip with generated .aar and .jar files should be in the directory: /release/zipped

```
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```
### Regenerate Javadocs

```
<devcenter.home> should be located in this relative path ../../<java-library.home>
cd <devcenter.home> 
git pull devcenter
cd <java-library.home>
./gradlew release
```
After these steps the generated Javadocs should be in the directory: /content

### Release

```
cd <java-library.home>
./gradlew release
```
After these steps .zip with generated .aar and .jar files should be in the directory: /release/zipped

### Explicit release steps (including the above)

Find and replace the library's version number in build.gradle of the projectâ€™s directory and double check/update  location
```
git pull devcenter
cd <java-library.home>
./gradlew release
```
.zip with generated .aar and .jar files should be in the directory: /release/zipped

Login to AWS S3 and upload zip from trunk/release

```
cd <devcenter.home> 
npm start
```
If you have strange errors from above, try:
```
npm install 
or 
npm update
```

```
cd <devcenter.home>/content/downloads
```
Update changelog:
- modify links in content/downloads.json
- modify links in content/downloads/android-changelog.json
- modify links in content/downloads/android-v3.0-changelog.json

You can see Javadocs changes in your browser at localhost:3000
