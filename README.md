Kinvey Java Library
======

This library is a standalone library designed for all java evnironments.
The library acts as a client for the Kinvey REST api and can be used for
building Android apps and Java6 server applications.

It is recommended you use either IntelliJ or Android Studio. Eclipse is NOT recommended.

## Documentation
Refer http://devcenter.kinvey.com/android for complete documentation of the library APIs and usage.

## Overview of the Library

The codebase is made of the following key projects at the top level (under java-library): 

### java-api-core 
The core of the library. Most of the library logic is written here. This project contains most of the underlying networking, user management, caching logic. Things that are platform specific (android-specific or standalone-java-specific) are represented as interfaces / abstract classes, and implemented in the other libraries described below.

### android-lib
The wrapper library for android, built on top of java-api-core. All the android specific implementation goes here. Most of the classes in this library extend from the ones in java-api-core.


### android-secure
Encryption module built on top of android-lib. Rarely used; not compiled into the standard build process. This may be requested by certain customers who need encryption in their app.

### samples 
Samples built on top of the libraries. This is a submodule, the full source for samples is under https://github.com/KinveyApps

## Build
Pre-requisites:

* [android sdk](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* Set JAVA_HOME
* Set ANDROID_HOME
* Download android_sdk/platforms/android-19, android_sdk/platforms/android-10

```
./gradlew clean
```

```
./gradlew release
```
After these steps .zip with generated .aar and .jar files should be in the directory: /release/zipped

```
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

### Test
Before running the tests:

 * Connect android device or start emulator with min SDK version 15
 * Add app.key and app.secret to android-lib/src/androidTest/assets/kinvey.properties
 * Create User with username: test password: test in your console app
 * Custom endpoints tests and Social networks tests should be configured additionally 

```
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest --info
```

### Regenerate Javadocs

```
<devcenter.home> should be located in this relative path ../../<java-library.home>
cd <devcenter.home> 
git pull devcenter
cd <java-library.home>
./gradlew release
```
After these steps the generated Javadocs should be in the directory: /content

### Release

```
cd <java-library.home>
./gradlew release
```
After these steps .zip with generated .aar and .jar files should be in the directory: /release/zipped

### Explicit release steps (including the above)

Find and replace the library's version number in build.gradle of the projectâ€™s directory and double check/update  location
```
git pull devcenter
cd <java-library.home>
./gradlew release
```
.zip with generated .aar and .jar files should be in the directory: /release/zipped

Login to AWS S3 and upload zip from trunk/release

```
cd <devcenter.home> 
npm start
```
If you have strange errors from above, try:
```
npm install 
or 
npm update
```

```
cd <devcenter.home>/content/downloads
```
Update changelog:
- modify links in content/downloads.json
- modify links in content/downloads/android-changelog.json
- modify links in content/downloads/android-v3.0-changelog.json

You can see Javadocs changes in your browser at localhost:3000

Test locally devcenter and java-library

# [Kinvey Android SDK](https://devcenter.kinvey.com/android)

![badge-jitpack] ![badge-status] ![badge-coverage]

# Overview

[Kinvey](https://www.progress.com/kinvey) is a high-productivity serverless application development platform that provides developers tools to build robust, multi-channel applications utilizing a cloud backend and front-end SDKs. As a platform, Kinvey provides many solutions to common development needs, such as a data store, data integration, single sign-on integration, and file storage. With Kinvey, developers can focus on building what provides value for their app - the user experience (UX) and business logic of the application. This approach increases developer productivity and aims to enable higher quality apps by leveraging Kinvey's pre-built components.

# Features

The Kinvey Android SDK repository represents the package that can be used to develop Android apps on the Kinvey platform. The Kinvey SDK is developed using a mix of Kotlin and Java code, with a gradual transition being made to a completely Kotlin codebase.

## Contents

The following is a high-level overview of the most important projects in the solution:

* `java-api-core` The core of the library. Most of the library functionality is written here. This project contains most of the underlying networking, user management, caching logic. Things that are Android-platform specific are represented as interfaces / abstract classes, and implemented in the `android-lib` library described below.
* `android-lib`: The wrapper library for Android, built on top of `java-api-core`. All the Android-specific implementation is located here, and most of the classes in this library extend from the ones in `java-api-core`.

## Using the SDK

Refer to the Kinvey [DevCenter](http://devcenter.kinvey.com/android) for guides and documentation on using Kinvey.

# Releases

Versioning of the Kinvey SDK follows the guidelines stated in [Semantic Version 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

# Build Instructions

In order to build this repository, the following pre-requisites must be in place:

* [android sdk](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* Set JAVA_HOME
* Set ANDROID_HOME

Once these are set, you can run the following commands:

```
./gradlew clean
```

```
./gradlew release
```

After performing these commands, a `.zip` file with generated `.aar` and `.jar` files should be in the `/release/zipped` diretory.

# Test Instructions

```
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

Before running the tests:

 * Connect android device or start emulator with min SDK version 15
 * Add app.key and app.secret to android-lib/src/androidTest/assets/kinvey.properties
 * Create User with username: test password: test in your console app
 * Custom endpoints tests and Social networks tests should be configured additionally

```
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest --info
```
